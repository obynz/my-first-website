CodeInstitute Learning Git and GitHub

This is m y early introduction into the fullstack development course. I hope 
I'll be like some of these guys on this course someday.

The aim of this course is to learn how to effectively use modern devops tool
and development framework so I can be better at my current role while
picking up new skills to make me more versatile.

So far, I have learnt - 
HTML5
CSS3
and currently on Usercentric Frontend Develpment.


Wish me all the best
